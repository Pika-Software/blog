Hey, this is my first blog post. I am experimenting with using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), 
since I wan't to write my first post about fixing resolve of AAAA records in IPv4 only networks with IPv6 only VPN *(coming soon TM)*

I plan to host to host this blog on Github Pages, update with Github Actions and connect my domain [p1ka.eu]("https://p1ka.eu"). Maybe even my friend Unknown Developer will write some blog posts!

Anyway, here it is, **Pika Software** blog!

Also I wanted to add something personal to this post, so there is one of my photos I made during [Valgus kõnnib day](https://www.tallinn.ee/et/valguskonnib).
